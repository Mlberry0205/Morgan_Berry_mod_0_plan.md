Game plan for success and Markdown practice
## Below is my plan for _success_ in Mod 0 at Turing
1. Get familiar with Git, GitHub, Trello, Slack, Termianl commands, and asking for help.
2. Be sure to set enough time throughout the day to work on getting familiar w/ above list. 
3. Ask your fellow students for help, as many people might be having the same issues.
