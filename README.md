Game plan for success and Markdown practice
## Below is my plan for _success_ in Mod 0 at Turing
### Things to do:
1. Get familiar with Git, GitHub, Trello, Slack, Termianl commands, and asking for help.
2. Be sure to set enough time throughout the day to work on getting familiar w/ above list. 
3. Ask your fellow students for help, as many people might be having the same issues.
### Things NOT to do:
+ Feel like you are falling behind and not ask for help
+ block off 4 hour time blocks.  Break your work into sections
+ Keep up on yor google calendar-Continue to edit and revise.
+ leave room for mental and emotional health

We can learn a few `tips` from this `cat`:
